# Network Motif Analysis

## Project Description
This project aims to use network motifs (small but recurring patterns in networks) to distinguish biased citation networks from unbiased ones. To do so, we developed an algorithm to generate the network null model for statistical testing.

We tested our methods on two datasets. One dataset include a biased citation network (the hygiene hypothesis network), and the other include an unbiased network (the diesel and lung cancer network).

We used motifr package to compute the numbers of multi-level network motifs in the networks:
